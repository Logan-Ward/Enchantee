# Enchantee

WIP
A message board app where users can create private rooms with 
specific invitees or public rooms with specific topics or intents. 
The defining feature of this application will be the chaotic, 
"brain-stormey" way the messages will appear in the chat room. The
primary emphasis will be on custom animations for entry, lifetime, 
and exit that can either be pre-defined or created on the fly to 
match the tone of the statement. As the animations will not have 
any set start or end positions, the nature of the discussions will
not be linear, rather communal/collaborative such as a stream chat.
As a secondary goal, this application would likely be benefited
either with the ability to set a centerpiece within the app to 
stimulate and lead discussion, such as image, text, or video to be 
commentated on, or by being modular enough in design to be grafted 
onto existing applications as a supplementary form of interaction. 
Another form of engagement could be a liking feature where users 
can like a message which will grow its size and extend its 
lifetime.
