# LeChat

WIP
A discussion app that lets you engage with multiple conversations simultaneously. 
Conversations are arranged on an arrangeable grid that you can click and drag 
through and zoom in or out on. Might have a feature that shows the view window of 
others for more interaction, so people can see what is being focused on. To allow 
for editing of environment, holding ctrl will activate edit mode.

## Project setup
```
npm install

```
